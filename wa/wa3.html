        <p>Join more than 80 million players in this fast-paced, third-person action shooter and choose where your journey begins. Will you carve a path through the sprawling Origin System, or enter the mind-bending unreality of The Duviri Paradox?</p>
       
        <p>Guided by the mysterious Lotus, the Tenno undertake missions across the Solar System, using their Warframes' unique abilities, powerful weapons, and acrobatic combat skills.

        <h2>What is a Warframe?</h2>

        <p>Initially, Warframes were believed to be just advanced suits of armor, but as the story unfolds, it is revealed that they are infused with the consciousness of tortured and mutated warriors from an ancient experiment. These warriors were transformed by the Helminth virus under the guidance of the Orokin, a highly advanced but corrupt civilization. The Warframes themselves are partially sentient but require a Tenno to pilot them using their Transference ability—essentially controlling the Warframe remotely from a safe location.

            Each Warframe has its own set of four abilities and distinct playstyle, ranging from stealth-based assassins (like Loki), tanky brawlers (like Rhino), or elemental casters (like Ember and Frost). The Warframes are not the Tenno themselves, but rather powerful extensions of them, acting as their combat vessels in the ongoing wars against the Grineer, Corpus, Infested, and Sentients.</p>
        
        <h2>Travel the Origin System</h2>

        <p>The Origin System is constantly in turmoil, with the Tenno acting as warriors who balance power between factions. Major conflicts include:

            The Grineer vs. Corpus war for territory,the spread of the Infestation threatening all life, the resurgence of the Sentients, who seek revenge against the Orokin’s remnants. As the player progresses, they uncover secrets about the system’s history, their own origins, and the looming dangers beyond it.</p>
