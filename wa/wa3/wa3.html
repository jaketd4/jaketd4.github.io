        <!--Intro-->

            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p> Warframe is a free-to-play online action RPG and third-person shooter developed by Digital Extremes. The game takes place in a futuristic sci-fi universe where players control powerful biomechanical warriors called Warframes. These Warframes are piloted by the Tenno, an ancient race of warriors who have awakened from centuries of cryosleep to find themselves in a war-torn galaxy.</p>

                <p>The main conflict involves several factions:</p>
                
                <p><u>The Grineer</u>: A militaristic, clone-based empire with a decaying genetic structure that seeks to dominate the system.</p>
                <p><u>The Corpus</u>: A greedy, high-tech corporate faction obsessed with profit and robotics.</p>
                <p><u>The Infested</u>: A horrifying faction of organisms corrupted by the Technocyte Virus.</p>
                <p><u>The Sentients</u>: An advanced AI race from another system, originally created by humans, but now bent on destroying them.
                Guided by the mysterious Lotus, the Tenno undertake missions across the Solar System, using their Warframes' unique abilities, powerful weapons, and acrobatic combat skills. As the story unfolds, players uncover deep lore about their origins, the true nature of Warframes, and the hidden history of the universe.</p>

            <h2>What is a Warframe?</h2>
            <p>A Warframe is a biomechanical exosuit used by the Tenno, granting them enhanced abilities, agility, and combat prowess. These suits are powered by the Void, a mysterious energy source, and each Warframe has unique abilities that define its role in battle, such as offensive attacks, defensive barriers, healing, or crowd control.</p>

            <p>Initially, Warframes were believed to be just advanced suits of armor, but as the story unfolds, it is revealed that they are infused with the consciousness of tortured and mutated warriors from an ancient experiment. These warriors were transformed by the Helminth virus under the guidance of the Orokin, a highly advanced but corrupt civilization. The Warframes themselves are partially sentient but require a Tenno to pilot them using their Transference ability—essentially controlling the Warframe remotely from a safe location.</p>

        <!--Travel the Origin System-->
        <div id="sec3">
            <h2>Travel the Origin System</h2>
            <p>Sure! The Origin System is the primary setting of Warframe—a vast star system filled with different planets, moons, and celestial bodies that serve as battlegrounds for the game's various factions. It was once ruled by the Orokin Empire, a highly advanced but corrupt civilization that collapsed due to internal strife and the rise of the Sentients.</p>

            <h3>Structure of the Origin System</h3>
            <p>The system consists of familiar planets from our real Solar System, each with unique environments and enemy-controlled territories. Here’s a breakdown:

                <p><u>Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars</u> Dominated by the Grineer, a militaristic faction of decaying clones.</p>
                <p><u>Jupiter, Europa, Neptune, Pluto:</u> Controlled by the Corpus, a hyper-capitalist faction that worships profit and technology.</p>
                <p><u>Saturn, Ceres, Sedna:</u> Grineer strongholds, housing major cloning facilities and military fleets.</p>
                <p><u>Eris:</u> Infested-controlled, overrun by the grotesque bio-mutants of the Technocyte Virus.</p>
                <p><u>The Void:</u> A pocket dimension where remnants of the Orokin civilization still exist, filled with ancient treasures and powerful enemies.</p>
                <p><u>Lua (Earth's Moon):</u> A significant location tied to the Tenno’s past and Orokin experiments,</p>
